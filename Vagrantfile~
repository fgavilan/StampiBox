  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
   config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|

  #   vb.gui = true
  #
  #   # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
